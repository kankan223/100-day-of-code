#A simple calculator

int1 = int(input("Enter the first number : " ))    #input() is used to take input from user
int2 = int(input("Enter the second number : " ))   #int() is used to make the variable integer type

print ("The sum of the two number is : ", int1 + int2)           # + is used to add
print ("The difference of the two number is : ", int1 - int2)            # - is used to subtract
print ("The multiplication of the two number is : ", int1 * int2)            # * is used to multiply
print ("The division of the two number is : ", int1 / int2)            # / is used to devide float
print ("The quotient of the two number is : ", int1 // int2)           # // is used to devide integer
print ("The remainder of the two number is : ", int1 % int2)            # % is used to find remainder
print ("The exponential of the two number is : ", int1 ** int2)           # % is used to find exponent
